        <p class="lead mb-4">A young and ambitious first-year college student currently majoring in business at the University of California Riverside. Grew up in southern California and lived in Hong Kong for a period of time before returning. My experience in both worlds has embedded a more multicultural and open-minded perspective that can be utilized to problem solve effectively in the globalizing and fluctuating society we live in today.
        <br><br>

        Growing up in a gated community, I was oblivious to the outside world because my introverted nature sought comfort from within.  I was a shy child who kept myself to a close group of friends who were essentially my family. I wasn’t accustomed to changing at all; however, due to my father’s occupation, I was uprooted from my safe haven at the age of nine and forced to make a new life in a foreign country. 
        When Hong Kong became my new home, it soon occurred to me that I was trapped in the crossfire between two opposing cultures. From pouring tea for others before yourself to taking shoes off indoors; it became apparent that traditions were much more demanding. Although I had left the confines of my gated community, the inability to grasp nuances in Hong Kong’s culture alienated me.
        Wanting to escape my comfort zone and explore the world, I acquainted myself with a newfound diverse group of friends who would help me assimilate. My Singaporean friends spiced up my palette with chili crab, and my Australian friends twisted my tongue with slang I’d never heard before. Despite cultural differences, these groups managed to live amongst one another, which made me realize that the world isn’t simply black and white but rather filled with limitless shades of color. Forming these relationships has unlocked my independence and increased my understanding of varying opinions, allowing me to thrive in new environments. Soon enough, I was no longer the introverted kid confined to the gated community.  
        I returned to California at fifteen years old and upon entering Alhambra High, I recognized that communication and building relationships were pivotal assets. This time, change wasn’t an obstacle; Alhambra soon became my third home. 
        My desire to connect with others fuels my newfound extroverted nature, making it easy to form more relationships. My experiences from both worlds make me a unique candidate that can unify diverse groups on campus to strive for success together. Overall, I’ve learned that although change is inevitable, the future is mine to determine. 
        <br><br>

        After several months, what once was a small account has grown immensely, more than I had ever anticipated. With widespread support, my goal of influencing others has been achieved and my vision of food continues to spread. Although I was always told not to play with food, it has deepened my appreciation for it and has shown me the limitless purposes that food serves. My account reflects my personality that strives to bring happiness through unification. My creativity serves to provide an opportunity to experience the world through the concoction of dishes from contrasting cultures into a brewing pot of diversity. By exploring new horizons, more foreign cultures can be more easily integrated into today’s multicultural societies. As our world continues to grow, my contribution to unifying communities is an accomplishment that I will forever savor.
